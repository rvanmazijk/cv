MSc candidate in Biological Sciences at the [Dept. of Biological Sciences](http://www.biologicalsciences.uct.ac.za/), [University of Cape Town](http://www.uct.ac.za/), South Africa. I have broad interests in plant and animal phylogenetics systematics, community ecology, plant ecophysiology, climate change biology, statistical ecology, and computational and model-based methods. Striving for a career in research, academia and teaching.
