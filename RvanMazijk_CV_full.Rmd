> I am curiosity driven, interested in plant and animal phylogenetics and systematics, community ecology, plant ecophysiology, and the effects of climate change on the world's biota. I enjoy applying numerically and statistically grounded methods in these fields. My long-term goals are careers in research, academia, and teaching.
