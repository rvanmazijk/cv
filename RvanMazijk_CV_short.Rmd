I am curiosity driven, interested in plant & animal phylogenetics & systematics, community ecology, plant ecophysiology, & the effects of climate change on the world's biota. I enjoy applying numerically & statistically grounded methods in these fields. My long-term goals are careers in research, academia, & teaching.
